### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

### About me
My name is LJ. I am passionate about applying data science to foster evidence-driven public policy. I develop scripts to increase data accessibility and help expedite the collection of evidence. I primarily program in Python and R. I am also proficient in MATLAB and STATA. My research interests are Macroeconomics, Political Economy, and Applied Data Science.

I currently work at [Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD)](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/home.asp) as a Junior Economist.
