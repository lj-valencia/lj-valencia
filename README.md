### Hello there! My name is LJ ðŸ‘‹

I am an Economist who is passionate about applying data science to economic analysis and public policy. Programming languages that I currently use in my work are primarily Python and R. I am proficient in MATLAB and the [IRIS Macroeconomic Toolbox](https://iris.igpmn.org/), and STATA. My research interests focus on Macroeconomics, Political Economy, and Applied Data Science .

I currently work at [Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD)](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/home.asp) as a Junior Economist.
