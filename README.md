## About me
I graduated from the University of Alberta with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) in Economics with a minor in Political Science. 
  
My research interests focus on macroeconomics, political economy, data science, and computational economics.
  
I am curious about the macroeconomy, how political institutions and the economy influence each other, and the application of computational methods and data science to analyze and understand economic phenomena. 
 
Shortly after completing my studies at the University of Alberta, I worked at [Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD/DEO)](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/home.asp), now called [Prairies Economic Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development.html). 

I joined the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/) as a Research Assistant near the end of August 2021.
